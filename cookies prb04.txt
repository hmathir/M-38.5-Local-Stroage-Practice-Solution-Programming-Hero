An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store the cookie and send it back to the same server with later requests. Typically, an HTTP cookie is used to tell if two requests come from the same browser—keeping a user logged in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.

Cookies are mainly used for three purposes:

Session management:
Logins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember

Personalization:
User preferences, themes, and other settings

Tracking:
Recording and analyzing user behavior
